Welcome! This repo explores the probabilistic deep learning method known as diffusion models.

The "refs/" folder contains all kinds of good refs for diffusion models. Serves as a ref set for mini-review. 

diffusion-models.ipynb provides background and intro to diffusion models and Denoising Decoder Probabilistic Model (DDPM).

evidence-lower-bound.ipynb will provide background for studying derivations of ELBO.

pytorch-probability.ipynb demonstrates how the reverse diffusion process is modeled with a neural network or distribution with learnable paramaters.

LinearNoiseScheduler.py provides a helper class for scheduling and sampling the noise to be added to an input.
